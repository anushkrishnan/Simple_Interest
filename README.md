# Simple_Interest
C++ program to calculate the Simple Interest, using the Principle amount, Rate of Interest & Time Period obtained from the user.

Description:
This C++ program calculates simple interest based on user input. Simple interest is the interest earned on a principal amount over a specified period of time at a fixed interest rate. The formula for calculating simple interest is: Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.

The program prompts the user to input the principal amount, the interest rate, and the time period in years. It then performs the necessary calculations using the formula and displays the resulting simple interest.
